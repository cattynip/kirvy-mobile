# Webtoon App

This is a project for learning how to make a simple application with Dart, and Flutter. The course that I took was [Flutter For Beginners](https://nomadcoders.co/flutter-for-beginners?utm_medium=website&utm_source=webpage&utm_campaign=roadmap) from Nomadcoders.

Now, this project is done. Next project for learning Flutter but deeplier, is [TikTok Clone Coding](https://nomadcoders.co/tiktok-clone?utm_medium=website&utm_source=webpage&utm_campaign=roadmap), and the repository for that is [here](https://github.com/cattynip/ticktok).
